## Top 3 Ideas
- Farmers Market Directory / Participants / Contacts / Items sold / Events

- Craigslist/Offerup clone
    - **Category:** Shopping/ event listing app
    - **Mobile:** A Craigslist app would mostly make sense on a mobile device for accessibility and access to maps once an item is chosen.
    - **Story:** Users could use the app to find items, communicate with the seller, and navigate to the pick up location. Sellers could list items to sell and communicate with potential buyers. There may also be the ability to purchase through the app.
    - **Market:** Buyers looking to purchase used items or find local vendors of new products. Sellers looking to sell new and used items locally.
    - **Habit:** Some users may use the app daily if they are committed to finding local or previously owned items. Generally, it would be challenging to get a large group of users to consistently use the app.
    - **Scope:** The app would primarily focus on listing items for sale and facilitating the communication between buyers and sellers.
- Education / tutorial
    - **Category:** Education
    - **Mobile:** Mobile accessibility would be optimal for students, parents, and teachers to easily track student data.
    - **Story:** The app could track grades, attendance, and assignments. It could be used by all stakeholders (students, parents, and teachers) to track the progress that pertains to their role.
    - **Market:** School districts would purchase access to the app for all of their members.
    - **Habit:** Because the app tracks current data about students, all parties would want to check the information at least daily if not more often. 
    - **Scope:** The app could initially include basic information about attendance and assignments, but could be expanded to track data over time and provide interfaces to complete work.
